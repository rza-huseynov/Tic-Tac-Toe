# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is my first milestone project for Complete Python 3 Bootcamp on Udemy. To code this game, I used my knowledge of real case scenarios for the first time.

# How it Works 

The grids of the game are numbered with distinct integers through [1 - 9]. On each turn, the players choose their grid number and mark them with their character ('X' or 'O'). Players take turns in marking the grids, and the program constantly checks for the winner. After one of the players won the game, the program asks whether players wish to continue or not. So continues the games next rounds.

Very simple game idea. Just run it and enjoy playing this beautiful classical game on your PC.
